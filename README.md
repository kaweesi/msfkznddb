To execute the script; run:
./msfObsExporter.sh mysqlUser mysqlPassword databaseName 50000 /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/temp/mysql/

---------------------------
Where 50000 in this case is the number of results to be retrieved per each execution until completion for the whole database
And /Applications/XAMPP/xamppfiles/temp/mysql/ replaced with your MySQL's temporary folder


The script will execute asap and update the console window as it progresses
